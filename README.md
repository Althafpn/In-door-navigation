# VOICE DETECTION AND RESPONSE
This project explores the potential of voice recognition to improve human-robot
interaction. It investigates existing interaction dynamics and user preferences to refine
voice-based commands for robots. Optimizations aim for seamless integration and user
satisfaction in human-support scenarios. The project focuses on improving Natural
Language Understanding, command clarity, and error handling mechanisms for a more
natural and user-friendly experience. These advancements can benefit various
applications like manufacturing, eldercare, customer service, education, and
entertainment
